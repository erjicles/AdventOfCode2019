# Advent of Code 2019
To celebrate the end of 2019, I'm challenging myself to finish each of the 25
daily coding challenges from
[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

# Update
After a little over a month (minus the holidays and time spent caring for a 
9-month old), I finished! The fun definitely outweighed the *pain (see day 22
part 2 - shuffling 100 trillion cards 100 trillion times)*. Through the
laughter and tears, depths of self doubt and moments of triumph, I'm proud of
myself for sticking with it and seeing it through (though I think my wife has
other opinions about all the time I spent working on this). Assuming she
forgives me, I plan on trying AoC next year and hope to complete each challenge
on its day in December like an actual advent calendar!
